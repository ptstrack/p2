## Description
This is a simple multi-word password generator in the style of the great
xkcd comic. The intent is to provide the user with several options, select
the desired number of words (between 4 and 9), and choose whether to add 
a special character and/or number at the end of the password. Also, the
words within the password are separated by hyphens.

## Demo
Placeholder for now.

## Details for teaching team
I struggled with this project early on, trying to do too much without hitting
the basic requirements of the assignment.  I got wrapped up into trying
to query a wordlist and building functions, and then needed to leave for a 
business trip. I decided to scrap my previous work and start over with the
bare minimum to meet the desired objectives and deploy a functional site. I
can always go back and improve it later.

## Outside code
No outside code was used, other than what was learned during lecture and
leveraged a few example techniques learned from php.net
